Run instructions:

main.rs contains the classes that perform generation. "typical stuff" runs simulated annealing, "genetic" runs asexual genetic optimization, "load and score" scores the loaded layout in optimized_layout.json, and "load and print" prints out a representation of the loaded layout that's more human-readable. There are lots of magic constants and a lack of easy config and workflow due to my coding inexperience and the WIP nature of the project. Hopefully that can be fixed later...
